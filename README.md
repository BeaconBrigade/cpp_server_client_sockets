this is just a little something to play around with sockets in cpp. since we aren't doing much cpp in uni atm i figured i'd do some noww.

we'll see if i'll build something bigger but at the moment i'm just having fun :)

you can hook this up with tailscale. have a little piece of hardware running the server, then people who have your software can connect to the server and chat with each other over encrypted terminal based chatting
